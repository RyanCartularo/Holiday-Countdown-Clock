# Holiday Countdown Clock

Hi, thanks for checking out my website
This website is a countdown timer that will tell you how long it is until a given holiday
There is nothing too complex going on with this website, it uses vanilla Javascript CSS and HTML
That being said I am still pretty proud of this website because it was my first web aplication and the app that I used to teach myself all of those languages!

If you would like to check it out here is the [link](https://ryancartularo.github.io/Holiday-Countdown-Clock/)
